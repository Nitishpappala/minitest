        <h2 class="section-title">What is GPS Spoofing?</h2>
        <p>
          GPS Spoofing is a sophisticated technique where false satellite
          signals are generated to mislead GPS receivers. Spoofing can cause
          systems — including drones, autonomous vehicles, and ships — to
          compute false positions and velocities. This manipulation can allow
          attackers to redirect navigation systems, disrupt autonomous behavior,
          or hijack vehicles entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike jamming, which blocks signals entirely, spoofing subtly feeds
          fake information to the victim, maintaining the illusion of normalcy.
          Attackers can either overlay legitimate signals or completely replace
          them to achieve their objectives.

          How Spoofing Impacts UAVs & Autonomous Systems
        </h2>
        <p>
          Modern UAVs (drones) rely on a fusion of sensors — GPS, IMUs (Inertial
          Measurement Units), vision, and sometimes LiDAR. However, GPS remains
          the primary global positioning system due to its worldwide coverage.
          If an attacker successfully broadcasts spoofed signals, the UAV may
          drift toward false locations, enter no-fly zones, or even lose control
          entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the real world, incidents of GPS spoofing have caused both civilian
          and military drones to land unexpectedly or crash. Research presented
          at the USENIX Security Symposium has shown how a low-cost spoofing
          setup can be used to mislead drones without touching their software.

        <h2 class="section-title">Real-World GPS Spoofing Incidents</h2>
        <p>
          GPS spoofing has been used in various military and civilian incidents.
          Ships have reported sudden changes in location while anchored, and
          multiple UAVs have been reported lost due to GPS manipulation.
          Military-grade spoofing tools are capable of seamlessly transitioning
          from authentic signals to spoofed ones, making detection extremely
          challenging in real-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such attacks highlight the need for robust GPS anomaly detection tools
          — both at the software and hardware level. Organizations such as the
          US Department of Homeland Security have recognized GPS spoofing as a
          critical infrastructure threat.

          Detecting and Defending Against GPS Spoofing
        </h2>
        <p>
          Defending against GPS spoofing is challenging, especially when the
          attacker can generate high-quality counterfeit signals. However,
          detection is possible by observing anomalies in signal parameters such
          as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sudden changes in signal strength (CN0)</li>
          <li>Carrier phase irregularities</li>
          <li>Position jumps without corresponding velocity changes</li>
          <li>Time drift inconsistencies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Combining sensor fusion, AI-driven anomaly detection, and hardware
          signal authentication offers the best chance of preventing spoofing.
